# Brain MRI data sharing guide for Dutch researchers

With the increasing amount of data sharing initiatives, researchers collecting brain MRI data cannot and do not want to stay behind. However, many researchers do not know where to start, what they can share and where, where they can find information or support, etc. Therefore, we developed a brain MRI data sharing guide for researchers in the Netherlands who are new to open science and data sharing.

## Project development

- In October 2019, we had a [hackathon](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/open-science-community-leiden/news/oscl) at Leiden University about sharing MRI data via the [Open Science Community Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/open-science-community-leiden). Here, we formed a group of research supporters and researchers. In the next months, we developed a [first version](https://github.com/DorienHuijser/DecisionTreeMRIData/blob/master/old/20200125_DecisionTree_FlowChart_v1.4.bmp) of the guide.
- During an [OpenMR Benelux 2020](https://openmrbenelux.github.io/) [hackathon](https://github.com/OpenMRBenelux/openmrb2020-hackathon/issues/4), we worked further on the guide.
- The first version of the guide has now been published on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3822289 (June 19, 2020)
- After the first version was published, we started collaborating with colleagues from VU Amsterdam, in order to make the guide clearer and provide supporting information.
