# MRI data sharing guide for researchers in the Netherlands

With the increasing amount of data sharing initiatives, researchers collecting MRI data cannot and do not want to stay behind. However, many researchers do not know where to start, what they can share and where, where they can find information or support, etc. Therefore, at Leiden University (the Netherlands), we developed a MRI data sharing guide for researchers who are new to open science and data sharing and do not know where to start when they want to share their MRI data.

## Project development
- In October 2019, we had a [hackathon](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/open-science-community-leiden/news/oscl) at Leiden University about sharing MRI data via the [Open Science Community Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/open-science-community-leiden). Here, we formed a group of research supporters and researchers. In the next months, we developed a [first version](https://github.com/DorienHuijser/DecisionTreeMRIData/blob/master/old/20200125_DecisionTree_FlowChart_v1.4.bmp) of the guide.
- During an [OpenMR Benelux 2020](https://openmrbenelux.github.io/) [hackathon](https://github.com/OpenMRBenelux/openmrb2020-hackathon/issues/4), we worked further on the guide.
- The guide has now been published on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3822289 (June 19, 2020)
- I shortly talked about the guide at the [OHBM Open Science Room 2020](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/) on June 23, 2020. See the talk abstract and slides [here](https://github.com/ohbm/osr2020/issues/55)

## Future steps
- process feedback on the first published version via google drive, twitter, email, etc.
- include multiple types of data besides MRI data
- include solutions applicable internationally (e.g., in the entire EU instead of Netherlands only)
