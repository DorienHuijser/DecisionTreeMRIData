# Decision Tree sharing MRI Data
With the increasing amount of data sharing initiatives, researchers collecting MRI data cannot and do not want to stay behind. However, many researchers do not know where to start, what they can share and where, where they can find information or support, etc. Therefore, at Leiden University (the Netherlands), we started to develop a decision tree on sharing MRI data for researchers who are new to open science and data sharing. Among our group are both researchers and support people, but we would like to have more input on possible solutions and questions to be asked in the decision tree.

A possible extension of this initiative may include multiple types of data besides MRI data, as well as more details about tackling the GDPR. These are however outside of the scope of the current decision tree.
