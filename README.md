# Decision Tree Sharing MRI Data for researchers in the Netherlands

With the increasing amount of data sharing initiatives, researchers collecting MRI data cannot and do not want to stay behind. However, many researchers do not know where to start, what they can share and where, where they can find information or support, etc. Therefore, at Leiden University (the Netherlands), we started developing a decision tree on sharing MRI data for researchers who are new to open science and data sharing and do not know where to start when they want to share their MRI data. Among our group are both researchers and support people, but we would like to have more input on possible solutions and questions to be asked in the decision tree.

## Possible extensions in the future
- include multiple types of data besides MRI data
- include more details about tackling the GDPR
- include solutions applicable internationally (e.g., in the entire EU instead of Netherlands only)

## Project development
In October 2019, we had a [hackathon](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/open-science-community-leiden/news/oscl) at Leiden University about sharing MRI data via the [Open Science Community Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/open-science-community-leiden). Here, we formed a group of research supporters and researchers. In the next months, we developed a [first version](https://github.com/DorienHuijser/DecisionTreeMRIData/blob/master/20200125_DecisionTree_FlowChart_v1.4.bmp) of the decision tree. During [OpenMR Benelux 2020](https://openmrbenelux.github.io/), we worked further on the decision tree.

## Update June 2020
- The decision tree is currently under development at the Leiden University Library communications department. As soon as the decision tree is finished, it will be published on Zenodo. The link will appear here as well. 
- I will shortly talk about the decision tree at the [OHBM Open Science Room 2020](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/), June 23.
