# MRI data sharing guide for researchers in the Netherlands

With the increasing amount of data sharing initiatives, researchers collecting MRI data cannot and do not want to stay behind. However, many researchers do not know where to start, what they can share and where, where they can find information or support, etc. Therefore, at Leiden University (the Netherlands), we developed a MRI data sharing guide for researchers who are new to open science and data sharing and do not know where to start when they want to share their MRI data.

**:tada: You can find the first version of the MRI data sharing guide [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3822289):tada:**  

With feedback from multiple researchers and research supporters, we are now making the sharing guide to apply to the whole of the Netherlands. **Feel free to [contribute](#how-to-contribute)**!

## Project development
- In October 2019, we had a [hackathon](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/open-science-community-leiden/news/oscl) at Leiden University about sharing MRI data via the [Open Science Community Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/open-science-community-leiden). Here, we formed a group of research supporters and researchers. In the next months, we developed a [first version](https://github.com/DorienHuijser/DecisionTreeMRIData/blob/master/old/20200125_DecisionTree_FlowChart_v1.4.bmp) of the guide.
- During an [OpenMR Benelux 2020](https://openmrbenelux.github.io/) [hackathon](https://github.com/OpenMRBenelux/openmrb2020-hackathon/issues/4), we worked further on the guide.
- The guide has now been published on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3822289 (June 19, 2020)
- I shortly talked about the guide at the [OHBM Open Science Room 2020](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/) on June 23, 2020. See the talk abstract and slides [here](https://github.com/ohbm/osr2020/issues/55)
- We are now (October-December 2020) improving the guide after feedback from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DorienHuijser/status/1273982821959426049) and colleagues at different Dutch universities. The plan is to make the guide clearer and provide a supporting document for more information.
